# HM Testate

Scripts to prepare student data and validate submitted PDF files against submitted MD5 hashes. The scripts are based on [MD5 Validator](https://github.com/luiul/md5-validator), but are split into subscripts with better annotations. 

## Workflow

Overview of the weekly workflow: 

- Run the 0th script once at the beginning of the course to prepare the student data. Data not submitted by the deadline must be added manually. 
- Run the 1st script after students have submitted their PDF files and MD5 hashes.
- Run the 2nd script after you have graded the submissions.

For more details on how the scripts work, see [MD5 Validator](https://github.com/luiul/md5-validator).
